=== Book 1: Europe After the Reign ===
On Guy Fawkes Night in London in 1997, a financially desperate 16-year-old, Evey Hammond, sexually solicits men who are actually members of the state secret police, called "The Finger". Preparing to rape and kill her, the Fingermen are dispatched by V, a cloaked anarchist wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, who later remotely detonates explosives at the Houses of Parliament before bringing Evey to his contraband-filled underground lair, the "Shadow Gallery". Evey tells V her life story, which reveals that a global nuclear war in the late 1980s has since triggered the rise of England's fascist, white supremacist government, Norsefire.
Meanwhile, Eric Finch, a veteran detective in charge of the regular police force"the Nose"begins investigating V's terrorist activities.
Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including "the Finger," led by Derek Almond, and "the Head", embodied by Adam Susan: the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's Fate computer system.
Finch's case thickens when V mentally deranges Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality; forces the suicide of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a Paedophile priest; and prepares to murder Dr.
Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch.
Finch suddenly discovers that the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at a former Norsefire "resettlement camp" near Larkhill.
That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that Va former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experimentswas able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers to keep his true identity hidden.
Finch reports these findings to Susan, who suspects that this "vendetta" is actually just a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.
