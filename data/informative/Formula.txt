In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically as in a mathematical or chemical formula.
The informal use of the term formula in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given quantities.
The plural of formula can be spelled either as formulas or formulae (from the original Latin).
In mathematics, a formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language.
For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion; but, having done this once in terms of some parameter (the radius for example), mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume: This particular formula is:

V = 4/3  r3

V = 4/3 π r3

Having obtained this result, and knowing the radius of any sphere in question, we can quickly and easily determine its volume.
Note that the volume V and the radius r are expressed as single letters instead of words or phrases.
This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate larger and more complex formulas.
Mathematical formulas are often algebraic, closed form, and/or analytical.

In modern chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus (+) and minus () signs.
For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water, specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom.
Similarly, O

3 denotes an ozone molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and having a net negative charge.
In a general context, formulas are applied to provide a mathematical solution for real world problems.
Some may be general: F = ma, which is one expression of Newton's second law, is applicable to a wide range of physical situations.
Other formulas may be specially created to solve a particular problem; for example, using the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay.
In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations.
Expressions are distinct from formulas in that they cannot contain an equals sign (=). Whereas formulas are comparable to sentences, expressions are more like phrases.
