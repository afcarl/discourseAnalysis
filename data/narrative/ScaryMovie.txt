An 18-year-old girl named Drew Decker (Carmen Electra) receives a threatening phone call while home alone one night.
Drew is chased outside by Ghostface, who stabs her in the breast, removing one of her silicone breast implants.
She is hit by a vehicle driven by her father, who was distracted by oral sex by his wife, and is then subsequently murdered by Ghostface.
The next morning, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) meets up with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze (Jon Abrahams) and her friends, Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Greg Phillipe (Lochlyn Munro), and Buffy Gilmore (Shannon Elizabeth). Various news teams, including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri), converge on the school in the wake of Drew's murder.
Gail hooks up with Buffy's mentally disabled brother Doofy (Dave Sheridan) hoping to milk the facts out of him.
While Cindy is in class, she receives a note reading: "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST HALLOWEEN!". She then realizes that Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man (Lloyd Berry) during a wild car ride.
That night during a beauty pageant, Greg is killed by Ghostface, with the audience mistaking Buffy's screams as being part of her act.
When Buffy realizes she's won the pageant, she almost immediately forgets about Greg's death and celebrates her victory.
After Cindy goes home alone, she gets attacked by the killer.
After Cindy locks herself in her room and contacts the police, Ghostface disappears.
Bobby arrives momentarily after hearing the incident, but a pair of black gloves and a telephone fall out of his pocket, leading Cindy to believe that he was the killer.
Bobby is arrested and taken to the police station.
The next morning in the girls locker room at school, Buffy, high on the success of her victory at the pageant, ignores Cindy's warnings about the killer and is beheaded by Ghostface, though her severed head somehow remains alive.
That night, Ray and Brenda go to a showing of Shakespeare In Love, where Ray is stabbed in the ear through a bathroom stall.
Ghostface then goes after Brenda.
Unfortunately, angry movie patrons, fed up with Brenda's rude behavior during the movie, kill her before Ghostface can.
Meanwhile, Cindy throws a house party, hoping for safety in numbers.
During the party, Bobby and Cindy go upstairs and have sex, no longer making Cindy a virgin.
Ghostface suddenly appears and stabs Bobby, before disappearing quickly.
Cindy gets a gun from a drawer near the entrance, Bobby follows and she tends to his wounds.
Brenda's stoner brother Shorty (Marlon Wayans) comes up from the basement and informs them that all of the partygoers have fled the house as Ghostface began murdering some.
Bobby takes the gun and shoots Shorty, revealing that his wound was an elaborate ruse.
Ray arrives on the scene, alive; he and Bobby announce their plan to Cindy, that they are going to kill her and her father (Rick Ducommun) (despite the fact that they are not actually the killers). Ray and Bobby also plan to make themselves look like heroes by giving each other stab wounds to indicate they fought back, but the plan backfires when Ray stabs Bobby repeatedly, furious because his favorite show, The Wayans Bros., has been cancelled.
Ghostface abruptly arrives and attacks Cindy during a fight of karate after stabbing Ray, but she successfully subdues him by employing moves copied from The Matrix (and by doing a brief Irish jig while levitating) and kicks him through a window.
Nonetheless, Ghostface vanishes before the police arrive.
At the police station, Cindy and the local sheriff (Kurt Fuller) realize that Doofy, the only one who knew about the car accident, was actually faking his disability and is the true killer.
Unfortunately, Doofy has already escaped with Gail Hailstorm.
Upon finding his discarded disguise in the street, Cindy begins screaming, but is soon hit by a car.
In a post-credits scene, Shorty appears and breaks the fourth wall by giving tips on how to survive this sort of "situation". They appear to be on how to survive in a horror movie, but turn out to be tips on how to successfully enact a snatch n run.
