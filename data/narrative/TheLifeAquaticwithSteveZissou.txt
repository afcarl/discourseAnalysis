While oceanographer Steve Zissou is working on his latest documentary at sea, his best friend Esteban du Plantier is eaten by a creature Zissou describes as a "Jaguar shark." For his next project, Zissou is determined to document the shark's destruction.
The crew aboard Zissou's aging research vessel Belafonte includes his estranged wife Eleanor, chief strategist and financial backer; Pelé dos Santos, a safety expert and Brazilian guitarist who sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese; and Klaus Daimler, the German first mate who views Zissou and Esteban as father figures.
Minor crew members include Vikram Ray, cameraman; Bobby Ogata, frogman; Vladimir Wolodarsky, physicist and soundtrack composer; Renzo Pietro, sound man; and Anne-Marie Sakowitz, script girl.
Also included is a recent group of unpaid interns from the (fictional) University of North Alaska.
The "Team Zissou" venture has hit a decline, however; having not released a successful documentary in nine years.
Ned Plimpton is a longtime Zissou fan whose mother had recently died, and he believes that Zissou is his father.
After they meet at Zissou's latest premiere, Ned takes leave from his job as an airline pilot in Kentucky to join his crew.
As Oseary Drakoulias, Zissou's producer, can not find anyone to finance their latest documentary, Ned offers his inheritance.
Eleanor feels her husband is taking advantage of Ned and leaves.
A reporter, Jane Winslett-Richardson, comes to chronicle the voyage, and is also pregnant with her married boss' child.
A rivalry develops between Ned and Zissou (who are both infatuated with Jane), while Klaus becomes envious of the attention Zissou pays to Ned.
On their mission to find the Jaguar shark, the Belafonte steals tracking equipment from a remote station owned by Alistair Hennessey, Zissou's nemesis and a comparatively more successful oceanographer.
They then sail into unprotected waters and are attacked by Filipino pirates, who steal Ned's money and kidnap Bill Ubell, a "bond company stooge" assigned to the project.
They are then rescued by Hennessey and towed to Port-au-Partois.
Sakowitz, along with all but one of the interns, jump ship once they reach port.
Zissou convinces Eleanor to rejoin the Belafonte, and then leads the crew on a rescue mission; they save Bill, along with Hennessey, who also becomes kidnapped by the pirates.
While Ned and Zissou make one last search for the shark in the ship's helicopter, the aircraft malfunctions and they crash.
Ned dies from his injuries and is buried at sea.
Prior to Ned's death, Eleanor revealed to Jane that Zissou is actually sterile, therefore Ned could not have been his son.
Zissou finally tracks down the shark in a submersible but he decides not to kill it, both because of its beauty and not having any dynamite.
At the premiere of the finished documentary (which is dedicated to Ned), Zissou receives a grand ovation.
The crew returns triumphantly to the ship the next day, and the film ends with Pelé singing on stage as the credits roll.
