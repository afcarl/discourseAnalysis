The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses."
The scientific method is an ongoing process, which usually begins with observations about the natural world.
Human beings are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear and often develop ideas (hypotheses) about why things are the way they are.
The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways, including making further observations about nature.
In general, the strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled and replicated experiments that gather empirical data.
Depending on how well the tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection.
If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported a general theory may be developed.
Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features are frequently shared in common between them.
The overall process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions.
A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question.
The hypothesis might be very specific or it might be broad.
Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments.
Under modern interpretations, a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.
The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.
Experiments can take place in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars, and so on.
There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however.
Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.
Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (or to the same degree), and are not always in the same order.
