Marie Skodowska Curie (/kjri, kjri/; French: [kyi]; Polish: [kiri]; 7 November 1867  4 July 1934), born Maria Salomea Skodowska [marja salma skwdfska], was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.
She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win twice in multiple sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.
She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthon in Paris.
She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire.
She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Floating University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.
In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisawa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work.

She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and with physicist Henri Becquerel.
She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Her achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium.
Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes.
She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today.
During World War I, she established the first military field radiological centres.

While a French citizen, Marie Skodowska Curie (she used both surnames) never lost her sense of Polish identity.
She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland.
She named the first chemical element that she discoveredpolonium, which she isolated in 1898after her native country.

Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, due to aplastic anemia brought on by exposure to radiation while carrying test tubes of radium in her pockets during research, and in the course of her service in World War I mobile X-ray units that she had set up.
