In February 1966, while on a combat mission, Lt.
Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale), a German-born U.S. Navy pilot in squadron VA-145, flying from the carrier USS Ranger, is shot down in his Douglas A-1 Skyraider over Laos.
He survives the crash, only to be captured by the Pathet Lao.
Dengler is offered leniency by the Province Governor(Fran√ßois Chau), if he will sign a document condemning America, but he refuses.
Dengler is tortured and taken to a prison camp.
There he meets his fellow prisoners: American pilots Gene DeBruin (Jeremy Davies) and Duane W. Martin (Steve Zahn), Y.C., Procet and Phisit, some of whom have been captives for years.
Learning that the guards are planning to kill them all and return to their village, Dengler begins planning an escape.
He receives only grudging approval from the others, who have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the guards.
Dengler tells the others to meet him in the kitchen, but they do not show up.
He takes one of the submachine guns left unattended by the guards while they are eating in the kitchen, and kills some of the guards.
After the prisoners get out of the camp, Dengler confronts Gene for not showing up.
Gene and Y.C. leave together to an uncertain fate.
Dengler and Martin try to reach the Mekong River to cross over into Thailand, fashioning a crude raft, but are caught in rapids and a waterfall.
After losing their raft, Dengler and Martin are captured, and Martin is killed by a mob of angry villagers.
Dengler gets free and quickly flees back into the jungle, hiding from the pursuing villagers.
a few days later, he is eventually rescued by an American helicopter, but is kept isolated in a hospital for debriefing due to the classified nature of his mission.
He is visited by some of the men from his squadron, who covertly take him back to his ship, where he is welcomed as a hero by the crew.
