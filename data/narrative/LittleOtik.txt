Karel Hork (Jan Hartl) and Boena Horkov (Veronika ilkov) are a childless couple and for medical reasons are doomed to remain so.
While on vacation with their neighbors at a house in the country, Karel decides to buy the house at the suggestion of his neighbor.
When he is fixing up the house, he digs up a tree stump that looks vaguely like a baby.
He spends the rest of the evening cleaning it up and then presents it to his wife.
She names the stump Otk and starts to treat it like a real baby.
She then works out a plan to fake her pregnancy and becoming more and more impatient she speeds up the process and 'gives birth' one month early.
Otk comes alive and has an insatiable appetite.
Albtka (Kristina Adamcov), the neighbor's daughter, has been suspicious all along, and when she reads the fairy tale about Otesnek, the truth becomes clear to her.
Meanwhile little Otk has been just eating and growing.
At one point he eats some of Boena's hair, and another day she returns home to find that Otk has eaten their cat.
Karel and his wife are at odds with Karel pushing for killing the thing and Boena defending it as their child.
The baby later consumes a postal worker (Gustav Vondrek) and then a social worker (Jitka Smutn).
The resulting deaths lead Karel to tie up and lock Otk away in the basement of their apartment building, leaving Otk to starve.
Albtka secretly takes over as prime caretaker.
She tries to keep Otk fed with normal human food, but, when her mother stops her, she is forced to drawing straws (matches in this case) to choose a person to feed to Otk. The first victim is an old man and pedophile, Mr.
lbek (Zdenk Kozk), and the second victim is Karel himself, who had come with a chainsaw but on seeing Otk calls him "son" and drops the chainsaw.
Afterwards, Boena goes into the basement and is heard screaming.
In the end, Otk disobeys Albtka despite repeated warnings and eats Mrs.
Sprvcov's (Dagmar Stbrn) cabbage patch, prompting the old woman to take charge.
