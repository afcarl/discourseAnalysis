Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through (geological) time.
Organisms and biological communities often vary in a regular fashion along geographic gradients of latitude, elevation, isolation and habitat area.
Phytogeography is the branch of biogeography that studies the distribution of plants.
Zoogeography is the branch that studies distribution of animals.
Knowledge of spatial variation in the numbers and types of organisms is as vital to us today as it was to our early human ancestors, as we adapt to heterogeneous but geographically predictable environments.
Biogeography is an integrative field of inquiry that unites concepts and information from ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, and physical geography.
Modern biogeographic research combines information and ideas from many fields, from the physiological and ecological constraints on organismal dispersal to geological and climatological phenomena operating at global spatial scales and evolutionary time frames.
The short-term interactions within a habitat and species of organisms describe the ecological application of biogeography.
Historical biogeography describes the long-term, evolutionary periods of time for broader classifications of organisms.
Early scientists, beginning with Carl Linnaeus, contributed theories to the contributions of the development of biogeography as a science.
Beginning in the mid-18th century, Europeans explored the world and discovered the biodiversity of life.
Linnaeus initiated the ways to classify organisms through his exploration of undiscovered territories.

The scientific theory of biogeography grows out of the work of Alexander von Humboldt (17691859), Hewett Cottrell Watson (18041881), Alphonse de Candolle (18061893), Alfred Russel Wallace (18231913), Philip Lutley Sclater (18291913) and other biologists and explorers.
