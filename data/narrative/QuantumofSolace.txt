White (Jesper Christensen) in the boot of his car.
After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M who interrogates him regarding his organisation, Quantum.
M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), revealing himself as a double agent, attacks M, enabling White to escape.
Bond chases Mitchell and kills him.
Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering through tagged banknotes that Mitchell had a contact in Haiti.

Meanwhile, the head of the CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a non-interference deal with Greene to maintain access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil.
Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues.
Greene's men kill a Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), an adviser to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, after he fights with Bond.
M assumes that Bond killed him and has his passports and credit cards revoked when he refuses to return home and debrief.

At the La Paz airport, they are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands that Bond return to the UK immediately.
Bond seduces her before they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night.
At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene.
Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano.
They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond; and, in the ensuing struggle, Mathis is killed.
The following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft, and they skydive out of the burning plane into a sinkhole.
In the cave, Bond and Camille discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly.
Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns that Quantum murdered Fields by drowning her in crude oil.
M orders Bond arrested for disobeying orders, but he escapes.
He risks capture by doubling back to tell M that Fields demonstrated bravery in the field, and this is enough to convince M that Bond can be trusted.
Bond meets CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who discloses that Greene and Medrano will meet in the Atacama Desert to finalise their agreement.
Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's Special Activities Division when they attempt to kill him.
At an eco hotel in the desert, Greene reveals his true plans to Medrano: now that he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Greene forces Medrano to accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Bond infiltrates the hotel, kills the Chief of Police (Fernando Guilln Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and confronts Greene.

Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her parents and her sister.
The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire.
Bond then captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, before leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil.
Bond and Camille kiss before they part.
Bond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections.
Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of his true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate.
He spares Kabira's life and allows MI6 to arrest him.
Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found in the middle of the desert dead, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach.
M also reveals that Leiter has been promoted and has taken Beam's place.
She tells Bond that she needs him back, to which he points out that he never left.
As he leaves, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.
