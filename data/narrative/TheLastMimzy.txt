Presented as a story by a group of students and their teacher Lena that takes place in the distant future, The Last Mimzy is the story of the attempt by humans in the distant future to avert a catastrophic ecological disaster that has destroyed their world.
High tech devices disguised as toys are sent back in time to Noah and Emma Wilder, children living in early 21st century Seattle.
The "toys" are incomprehensible to Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) and Noah (Chris O'Neil), except for what appears to be a stuffed rabbit.
Sensing the paranormal strangeness of the devices, the children initially keep their discovery secret from their parents.
Emma becomes telepathically connected to the stuffed rabbit, named Mimzy, and learns how to operate the devices.
Interaction with the devices causes the children to develop advanced knowledge, genius-level intelligence and psionic abilities.
Due to her psychic connection with Mimzy, Emma's development of her abilities is much stronger than her older brother's; she is the only one to display empathy, telepathy, levitation, and telekinesis (though Noah can also communicate with her once she has telepathically contacted him). Emma is also the only one who can use the Spinners, strange spinning, telekinetically floating rocks that produce a force-field.
Noah's strong psionic/physic abilities are developed through a card and a seashell.
He gains increased intelligence, knowledge, telepathy, empathic communication and control over arthropods.
He can also use the card to telekinetically teleport objects through a small dimensional rift after staring at it and observing his surroundings.
At one point, Noah becomes somewhat envious of his sister's psionic prowess, but she reveals to him that even though she is the Chosen One, he is her Chosen Engineer and she cannot "build the bridge to the future" without him.
The children's unusual psionic and mental abilities and Emma's attachment to Mimzy alert their parents and schoolteachers to the devices.
Later, Noah accidentally fuses the card with a blue blob, turning it into a Generator that causes a power black-out over half the state of Washington, alerting the FBI to their activities.
The family is held for questioning by Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman (Michael Clarke Duncan), and it is revealed that Mimzy is actually a highly advanced form of artificial life utilizing nanotechnology created by Intel.
Mimzy has brought a message from humanity's distant future.
Emma explains that pollution has corrupted humanity's DNA.
Many rabbits like Mimzy have been sent to the past, but none have successfully returned.
Mimzy is the last one remaining, but is now dying.
The reason for the other Mimzys' deaths is that the Chosen Ones before Emma had no Engineers (like Noah) to help build the bridge across time.
Mimzy explains to the children that they must use the toys as a time machine to return it to the future with uncorrupted 21st century human DNA, which the people of the future can use to correct the damage to their DNA caused by ecological problems.
Despite attempts by the FBI to prevent them, Noah and Emma use their psionic abilities to escape so that they can activate a time portal.
Before leaving, Mimzy absorbs a tear from Emma, thus providing the DNA required to restore humanity's corrupted DNA.
Emma is almost sucked into the future with Mimzy, but Noah grabs Emma and pulls her out of the portal just as Mimzy is sent back to its own time.
Following the exodus, Noah's science teacher, who was present at the event, claims he has seen "numbers", referring to his fiance's desire to win the lottery.
The world has become a beautiful place, where humanity has integrated into the constructed ecosystems.
The story ends with Emma's teacher (Julia Arkos) calling on Emma in class, asking what she did over her weekend break.
Emma simply smiles.
