After his mother is killed by hunters Bambi (Alexander Gould) stumbles upon his father, the Great Prince of the Forest (Patrick Stewart), who takes him back to his den.
The Great Prince asks Friend Owl (Keith Ferguson) to find a doe to raise Bambi, since his duties are to his herd, but Owl informs him that because of the harsh winters the does can barely feed themselves, let alone any extra mouths.
The Great Prince has no choice but to look after Bambi until the spring.
Months later, the Great Prince allows Bambi to accompany his friends, Thumper (Brendon Baerg), and Flower (Nicky Jones), to see the Groundhog, whose shadow will foretell if winter will end soon.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Bambi lies to them about how close he and his father are, while the Great Prince keeps the truth of his mothers death from him.
At the ground hog ceremony, Bambi meets up with his crush Faline (Andrea Bowen). The Groundhog (Brian Pimental) is coaxed out of his hole, only to be scared back in again by Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), an older fawn than Bambi.
Ronno tries to impress Faline with his stories of hunters near the woods, and the whistles they use to imitate deer, but Bambi and Faline dont believe his tall tale.

Bambi and Ronno immediately dislike each other, but Bambi is intimidated by Ronno, afraid to stand up for himself, and is relieved when he leaves with his mother.
The other animals leave as well, and Bambi falls asleep waiting for his father to come get him.
But after many hours of waiting, Bambi dreams of his mother and hears her voice calling him into a meadow.
It turns out to be an ambush by human hunters, the same ones Ronno warned him about.
The Great Prince comes to his rescue and orders Bambi to run, but the fawn is too scared to obey.
Both manage to escape and Bambi is yelled at for almost getting himself killed.

While Bambi sleeps, the Great Prince tells Friend Owl that winter is ending and he should have no problem finding a doe now.

Ronno and Faline, hearing the commotion, investigate.
Bambi gets into another fight with Ronno when he sees him bothering Faline.
Ronno chases him and Thumper through the forest until Bambi leaps to safety over a large ravine.
The Great Prince, having seen the whole thing, is both angry at Bambi and impressed by his feat.
Ronno (jealous of the young prince) tries to leap after him, but falls into the chasm, thwarted for now.
The next day Bambi practices jumping with Thumper and Flower, determined to make his father proud again.
Thumper encourages him to just talk to the Great Prince, and the two finally connect when the older stag shares some wisdom with him about feeling the forest in his hooves.
The Great Prince finally decides to allow Bambi to come along with him on his patrols, and as the days progress the two get closer than ever.
He helps Bambi to overcome any obstacles in his path, as well as his fears, and Bambi helps him to loosen up and have fun; all the while Ronno continues to grow jealous of the young prince.
<<<<<<< HEAD
One morning, Friend Owl finds Bambi and the Great Prince playing and introduces them to Mena (Cree Summer), the doe hes found to be Bambi's new mother.
Bambi realizes the Great Prince planned on sending him away (unaware that hes changed his mind) and snaps at his father, telling him he wished he was with his mother instead of him.
The Great Prince changes his mind again, deciding hes not whats best for Bambi, and sends him to go live with his new mother.
Bambi, despite being immensely saddened, eventually accepts the change, deciding his own happiness isnt as important as his duties as a prince.
On the way to Menas den, Ronno shows up to taunt Bambi one last time and the two get into another fight that sets off a hunters trap, snaring Mena and alerting nearby humans.
While the cowardly Ronno flees Bambi saves Mena by leading the hunters dogs away from her, as his father works to set her free.
The dogs chase him through the forest, and his friends help him to fend them off.
Bambi keeps them away as long as he can, using the techniques the Great Prince taught him, until the hounds corner him on top of a rocky peak.
Bambi manages to escape the last one by kicking it off a cliff, but falls off as well when it crumbles beneath him.
His friends and his father all grieve him until Bambi reveals hes still alive, and he and the Great Prince reconcile.
Sometime later, Thumper shares his version of the adventure with the rest of his friends, while Bambi (whose antlers have just grown in) enjoys the tall tale with Faline.
Ronno appears and vows vengeance on both of them, until hes bitten on the nose by a snapping turtle and runs off screaming for his mother for help.
The gang is unfazed by Ronnos threat (unaware that he will indeed return in their future), and Bambi leaves to meet up with his father, who decided to raise him after all.
